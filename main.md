# The Beginner's Guide to Lua
This is a small little guide intended for beginners for Lua. This is a little side project to store all of my knowledge on Lua that I hope others hoping to start in Lua programming can read and look back on!

### About Lua 
Created in Brazil in 1993, Lua is a high-level, multi-paradigm, lightweight, easy-to-read and beginner-friendly programming language. Lua can be embedded with almost every programing language and is written in ANSI C, which allows Lua to use C statements in its code. Although lightweight and fast, it can be used in embedded system and scripting for video games. Its ease of use arguably surpasses that of Python and when using the Just-In-Time compiler, is faster than C++.
